# Free Version

There is a free version of the **Attribut&co** module. Essentially, it is the same module but with limited functionality. Visually, the free version does not differ from the paid one, except that the module's title includes the **(free)** label. For example:

**Attribut&co v3.2.8 (free)**.

The limitations of the free version concern changes to the database. You can perform any actions with **Attributes** or **Values**, just like in the paid version, but changes will not be saved. After reloading the page, everything will return to its original state.

The free version is intended for exploring the module's functionality, evaluating the convenience of working with attributes, and verifying its compatibility with your OpenCart store.

The terminology, descriptions, and characteristics of the free version are identical to those of the paid version.

Some features in the free version are fully available, such as **drag-and-drop sorting** of **Groups** and **Attributes**.
