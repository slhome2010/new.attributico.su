# FAQ

These questions are frequently asked.

<details>
  <summary>Reinstalled the license. Followed the instructions. Still free version...!</summary>

Possible reasons:

- Incorrect domain name. `domain.ru` and `www.domain.ru` are different domains.
- Downloaded an old license archive instead of a new one.
- License file was overwritten incorrectly (e.g., renamed a directory with uppercase letters).
- The license must be downloaded from the platform where the module was purchased. Resources are not updated synchronously.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>I'm interested in purchasing the module. Will it conflict with DreamFilter?</summary>

The module does not conflict with **DreamFilter**, **megaFilter**, or any other filter. It does not interact with the frontend or filters directly. Instead, it organizes **Attributes** in the database, which are then used by filters.

<details>
  <summary>Can I specify a test domain now and add more later?</summary>

Yes. You can update domains at any time, provided the number and characteristics comply with the [license](/license/license-install.md) terms.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>The module stopped working after migrating to a new hosting. Could this be the cause?</summary>

Try the following:

- Clear the store cache.
- Clear browser cache and cookies.
- Refresh modifiers.
- Reconfigure and save settings.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How to merge attribute values?</summary>

The module does not provide dedicated merging tools (e.g., Drag-and-Drop, context menu, or hotkeys) for values or templates.  
This simplifies the module's design, and merging can be achieved via batch renaming instead.  

To merge values or templates, simply edit the **Value** or **Template**. For details, see the [Editing](/module-features/editing.md) section.

<details>
  <summary>What steps should I take after parsing?</summary>

The module does not enforce a strict workflow but provides tools to automate manual tasks.  

One such tool is **[Category Attributes](/tools/category-attributes.md)**.  

:::info  
In settings, set the **[`Method`](/settings/product.md)** to **"Add default only to empty"**.  
Other options are self-explanatory.  
:::

Legend:  

- `C` = Category  
- `P` = Product  
- `A` = Attribute  
- `V` = Attribute Value  
- `D` = Default Template  

Example:  
Category `C1` contains product `P1` with **Attribute** `A1` (Value: `V1`).  
After adding **Attribute** `A2` (Value: `V2`) to `P1` and parsing, products `P2` and `P3` are added with their own attributes.

| *Diagram 1 – Working with Unfilled Default Templates*  

**Goal**: Unify **category attributes** so every product in `C1` has the same set of **Attributes**.  
**Action**: Apply the **Category Attributes** tool.  

:::warning  
Some values remain empty because the module cannot resolve ambiguities (e.g., **Attribute** `A1` might accept `V1` or `V4`).  
:::  

**Solution**: Define **Default Templates**. The result:  

| ![Working with Filled Default Templates](/img/tutorial/attribute_category_2.svg) |

| *Diagram 2 – Working with Filled Default Templates*  

All values are now consistently populated.  

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can the module display attributes under product images on the homepage?</summary>

No. This module operates exclusively in the admin panel and does not interact with the frontend. Future advanced versions may include such features.  
For frontend changes, consult your template/theme developers.
