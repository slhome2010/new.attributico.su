# Drag-and-Drop Technology
This is one of the conveniences provided by Attribut&co. For example, how much easier it is to drag an *Attribute* from one *Group* to another with a mouse instead of opening forms, adding a new *Group* name in one place, and removing it in another.

**Drag-and-Drop** technology capabilities:

- Dragging *Nodes* within a single tree.  
- Dragging *Nodes* between trees.  

Applied to our tasks:

- Changing the *Group* of an *Attribute*.  
- Sorting *Groups*.  
- Sorting *Attributes* within a *Group*.  
- Adding an *Attribute* to a category.  
- Changing the category of an *Attribute*.  
- Merging *Attributes* (combining) without losing *Values* and connections.

All actions supported by **Drag-and-Drop** can also be performed using the [context menu](/module-features/context-menu.md) or hotkeys. Everyone can choose the method that suits them best. All actions are listed in the [summary table](/module-features/summary-table.md).
