# Category Attributes

Using a set of attributes for bulk assignment to similar products is a key principle of this module. **Category Attributes** can be prepared in several ways.

## Drag-and-Drop

The simplest method is **Drag-and-Drop**. Just drag the selected **Attribute** (or multiple attributes using [multi-selection](/module-features/tree-features.md)) into the **Categories** tree or directly into the **Category Attributes** tree.

You can also check multiple categories and drag **Attributes** into all selected categories **in one move**.

For better understanding, we recommend watching the video with examples.

## Tool

Another method is using the [Category Attributes](/tools/category-attributes.md) tool.

## Adding Category Attributes to a Product  

Category attributes are added to a product according to the following settings:

- [Category Attributes](/settings/category.md)  
- [Inheritance](/settings/inheritance.md)  

For the tool, this setting is managed separately via the **"Assign category attributes to products"** checkbox.

You can also add **Category Attributes** in the **product form**. More details in the [Integration with OpenCart](/opencart-integration/category-attributes.md) section.

## Adding Attribute Values  

Along with adding **Category Attributes** to a product, their **Values** or, more precisely, the **Duty Template** can also be added. This depends on the settings:

- [Adding attribute values to a product](/settings/product.md).
