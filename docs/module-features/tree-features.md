# Working with the Tree {#using-tree}

To activate any tree element, click on it with the left mouse button.

To expand (open) a tree element, double-click on it with the left mouse button.

Right-clicking on a **node** will open a **context menu**.

Nodes can be dragged and dropped within the tree as well as between different trees, if allowed by the context of the action and control mechanisms such as `levelcontrol`, `selectcontrol`, and others.

Each possible action will be discussed in detail in the following articles.

## Multiple Selection {#using-select}  

All **Drag-and-Drop** and **Copy-Paste** actions can be performed not only on a single *Node* but also on multiple *Nodes* simultaneously.

To select multiple *Nodes*, hold **Ctrl** and click on the required elements (**`Ctrl + Click`**).

To prevent errors, the module includes a `selectcontrol` mechanism. For example, it is not possible to select both *Groups* and *Attributes* at the same time.
