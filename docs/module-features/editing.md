# Editing

Editing mode is enabled on a selected **Node** via `Shift + Click`, `F2`, or through the [context menu](/module-features/context-menu.md).

Data editing occurs separately in each tree and for each language. Synchronization ensures data integrity when necessary.

## Difference Between Editing **Templates** and **Values**  

:::tip
If you modify a **Value**, the changes will apply to all products where that **Value** is present, and consequently, to all **Templates** containing it.  
Thus, if a **Value** appears in multiple **Templates**, all of them will be affected.  
:::

:::tip
If modifications are made to a **Template**, this affects all products where the given **Attribute** and its value exactly match the edited **Template**. Other products and **Templates** will remain unchanged.  
:::

:::warning
Be sure to consider the specifics of **Value** editing as described in the [Value Comparison](/settings/comparison.md) settings.
