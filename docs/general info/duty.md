# Duty Template

*Duty Template \- default value.*

A natural desire is that when an Attribute is added to a product, a Value or set of Values should be added synchronously. Especially if the Values are the same and there are many operations to be performed.

These Values must be stored somewhere. This is what the Duty Template is for. It is there that the Values are stored, which will be substituted into the product by default, as soon as you add an Attribute to it.

To make the substitution happen, you should not forget about [settings](settings.html#settings-product).

The Duty Template can be modified multiple times to substitute other Values in other products without affecting the existing ones. To do this, you must use the `Substitute Duty Template into empty ones only` setting.

The Duty Template can be [deleted](using.html#using-duty-del).
