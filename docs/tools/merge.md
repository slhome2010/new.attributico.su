# Merge Duplicates

Duplicate **Attributes** can appear due to parsing, automated price list imports, or content manager errors. This tool allows you to merge duplicates without losing links to products or categories. A filter must be applied. The action will be performed for the **Groups** selected in the filter block.

Do not confuse this tool with [Attribute Merging](/module-features/merge.md).

:::info
Merging can be performed for any **Attributes**, including _explicit_ or _implicit_ duplicates that you define manually.

This tool follows the same merging rules but only applies to _explicit_ duplicates, meaning those that are 100% identical.
