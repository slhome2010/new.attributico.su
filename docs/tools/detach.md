# Remove Unlinked Attributes

As a result of parsing, automated price list imports, and other operations, duplicate **Attributes** or **Attributes** that are not linked to any product often appear.

Use this tool carefully, as deleted attributes may be needed later. Unlinked attributes do not negatively impact store performance, but they can slightly slow down search operations. If you want to keep your **Attributes** organized, this tool can help.

A filter must be applied for the tool to work. Select **Groups** by checking the corresponding box in the tree. You can select all at once by checking the topmost box.
