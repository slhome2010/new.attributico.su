# Remove Empty Values

Empty **Values** typically appear due to operator mistakes. The most common causes are:

1\. Clicking the "Save" button while manually editing a product form, when an **Attribute** has been added but no **Value** has been entered.

2\. Using Attribut&co to add an **Attribute** with an empty [Duty Template](/general-info/duty.md) to a category.

| ![Empty values1](/img/tutorial/empty4.jpg) |
|:--:|
| *Empty values in the product form* |

| ![Empty values2](/img/tutorial/empty5.jpg) |
|:--:|
| *Empty values in the Duty Template* |

As a result, products or categories with empty **Attribute Values** are created. These blanks look unappealing in store filters and can confuse customers.

Instead of manually searching the database for products with empty **Values**, you can use this tool to remove links to them.

:::tip
If your frontend filter automatically handles empty values, using this tool may not be necessary.
