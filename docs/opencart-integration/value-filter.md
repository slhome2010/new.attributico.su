# Value Filter {#integro-filter}

In stores with a large number of products, **Attributes**, and their **Values**, the list linked to the selection field can become very long. This can cause inconvenience when filling out the table. The filter allows you to limit the list.

| ![attribute](/img/tutorial/value_filter.png) |
|:--:|
| *List Filter* |

| **Switch** | **List** |
|:--|:--|
| `All` | Displays all **Values** of the given **Attribute** from all products, plus the **Default Template** |
| `Categories` | Displays **Values** only for categories selected on the **Links** tab (not to be confused with **Category Attribute Values**) |
| `Default` | Displays **Values** from the [Default Template](general-info/duty.md) |

The filter operates in real-time, and the **Values** list is reloaded immediately after switching modes. In large stores, delays may sometimes be noticeable, so after switching, it may be necessary to wait briefly.
