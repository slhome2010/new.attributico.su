# Group Attributes

Starting from version 3.2.8, it is now possible to add all **Group Attributes** from a selected list directly within the product form.

From the dropdown list, you can select the **Group** whose **Attributes** you want to add to the product form. Since there may be many groups, autocomplete is enabledâ€”allowing search and filtering as you type the group's name.
