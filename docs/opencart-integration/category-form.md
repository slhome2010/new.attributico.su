# Integration with the Category Form
As of now, integration at the category form level is maintained. A new **Attributes** tab should appear there.

:::warning
This integration is for informational purposes only. You can only view the attributes linked to a category. All operations with category attributes must be performed through the module. This approach prevents duplication of the module's functionality and minimizes modifications to the OpenCart engine, reducing the likelihood of errors and conflicts with other modifications.
