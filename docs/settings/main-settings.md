Adjust scrolling size.  
The scroll area height can be changed in the `/admin/view/stylesheet/attributico.css` file by modifying the property:

```css
.smart-scroll {height: 250px;}
```

Be cautious when opening the product form in a new window.
Changes in the product form are saved in the database, but the module only "picks them up" after reloading. Without a refresh, the data may be incorrect.
