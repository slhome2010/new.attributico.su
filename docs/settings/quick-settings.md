# Quick Settings

Some settings can be changed during operation. They are not saved after exiting.

If you select "Settings" in the [context menu](/module-features/context-menu.md), a tree management dialog window will appear.

## Dialog Window

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Auto-collapse** | When expanding a tree element, nearby sibling elements collapse to avoid cluttering the screen. Can be disabled if multiple expanded elements need to be visible. Linked to the "Expand" and "Collapse" options in the [context menu](/module-features/context-menu.md). |
| **Sorting order** | Allows temporarily disabling the sorting order in a specific tree. If disabled, sorting is alphabetical. |
| **Lazy loading** | Controls the tree loading mode. If enabled, child nodes are loaded on demand. If disabled, the entire tree loads at once. More details: [Node Loading](/general-info/lazy-load.md). |
| **Consider hierarchy** | Works only in the category tree. Allows managing recursive selection of subcategories. |
| **Discrepancies** | Works only in the product tree. Used for quick management of the [product selection](/general-info/product-filter.md). |
